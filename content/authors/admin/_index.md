I focus on multi-scale and THMC multi-physical coupling models for energy recovery and climate change, like hydraulic fracturing and CO2 geological sequestration. The short-term goal of our research is to understand carbon dioxide dissolving in water and interacting with reactive rock formations, such as basalts, to form stable minerals providing a permanent and safe carbon sink, and the long-term goal is to imitate and accelerates these natural processes to better control CO2 sequestration.
